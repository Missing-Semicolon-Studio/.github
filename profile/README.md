Welcome to Missing Semicolon Studio, this is a studio created by IceFly147 to explore the more creative and fun side of programming. Our projects include a catalog of games and fun websites which,while not neccesarily making the world a better place,certainly make it more fun.

## Our Projects

- [x] **Stalk**: The barebones social media that lets you keep up with friends and family without any distractions.
- [ ] **Earthcache**: A website which allows users to upload their favorite photos of our beautiful blue planet.🌍
- [ ] **ShapeShifter**: A mutant shape escapes from a testing facility from which it retains the ability to morph into various shapes
